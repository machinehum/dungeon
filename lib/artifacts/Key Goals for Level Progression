Key Goals for Level Progression
Steady Growth: Players feel rewarded at each level, but not overpowered.
Thematic Depth: Progression aligns with the kinship and class, reinforcing narrative and gameplay identity.
Meaningful Customization: Players make impactful choices that differentiate their characters.
Progression Framework
1. Level Cap

20 Levels: A traditional cap that aligns well with the 1–20 stat scale and offers meaningful milestones.
2. Points Per Level

2 Characteristic Points per Level:
Players earn points to distribute to characteristics at each level, allowing steady growth.
Total Points by Level 20: 40 additional points, which roughly doubles a starting kinship’s total (~60–62).
3. Milestones for Major Gains

Certain levels should grant special bonuses or abilities, adding flavor and excitement beyond just stat increases. For example:

Level 5: Unlock a minor class-specific ability or passive bonus.
Level 10: Gain a significant class-specific upgrade or kinship trait enhancement.
Level 15: Unlock a new, advanced ability tied to the character’s class or a stat threshold.
Level 20: Gain a capstone ability, representing mastery of the character’s class or lineage.
4. Stat Growth Rules

Stat Caps:
Any characteristic cannot exceed 20, maintaining balance and thematic alignment.
Kinships with "higher minimums" (e.g., Goliaths with 12 Strength) still cap at 20, preventing them from becoming overpowered.
Scaling Costs (Optional):
To prevent stacking all points into one stat, consider making higher values more costly:
Raising a stat from 1–10: 1 point per level.
Raising a stat from 11–15: 2 points per level.
Raising a stat from 16–20: 3 points per level.
5. Class-Based Progression Bonuses

Classes should shape how progression feels and play into a character's thematic strengths:

Knights: Gain a passive Bravery or Strength bonus every 5 levels.
Feybinders: Bonuses tied to Arcadia or Connectedness as they master fae magic.
Shadowblades: Incremental increases in Cunning or Speed to reflect their stealth and agility.
6. Experience Points (XP) and Leveling

Use a scaling XP system to slow down progress at higher levels, maintaining the challenge and longevity of the game.
Example XP Curve:
Level 1–5: Low XP requirements for early, fast progression.
Level 6–15: Moderate XP scaling.
Level 16–20: Steep XP scaling to make reaching the cap an achievement.
Introduce non-combat XP rewards, such as for roleplay, exploration, or solving puzzles, to balance different playstyles.
7. Optional Systems for Depth

Stat Threshold Unlocks: High characteristics unlock unique abilities or benefits.
Example: 16+ Arcadia lets a Druid summon more powerful creatures.
Class and Kinship Synergy: Reaching milestones in class-specific stats could enhance kinship traits.
Example: A Goliath with 15+ Bravery gains additional resistance to fear effects.
