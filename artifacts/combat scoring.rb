strength  7         3
speed     8         7
conn.     12        2
know.     6         10

conco     43.5      28.5       43.5 / (28.5 + 43.5) = 43.5 / 72 = x / 100 = 4350 / 72 = 60.42 / 100 = 60% chance to hit
damco     56        21         

damage constant denominator = 400 (max of 20 * 20)
map coefficient out of 400 to denominator of 20
so 56 / 400 = x / 20 = 2.8 / 20 , plus weapon bonus, minus armor score
