1. Fae's Arcadia (10-12 Minimum)
Why It’s Important:
Fae are inherently tied to the Otherworld and magic, so it makes sense that even the least attuned Fae has a stronger connection to nature and mysticism than most other kinships.
Gameplay Impact:
Makes them a clear choice for Arcadia-focused roles (e.g., Druids, Feybinders) while still leaving room for "against type" Fae who might focus elsewhere.
2. Stonekin's Strength (8-12 Minimum)
Why It’s Important:
Stonekin are defined by their physical resilience and earthy roots. Even the weakest Stonekin should start at a baseline of moderate Strength, ensuring they are reliably strong characters.
Gameplay Impact:
Reinforces their durability and makes them standout contenders for physically focused classes like Knights and Skalds.
3. Selkies' Arcadia (10-12 Minimum)
Why It’s Important:
Selkies, as creatures of the sea with deep ties to nature and mystery, need high starting Arcadia to reflect their magical and aquatic heritage.
Gameplay Impact:
Makes them an ideal choice for nature-based or magical roles while differentiating them from Shadows, which also have high Connectedness but lower Arcadia.
4. Goliath’s Bravery (10-12 Minimum)
Why It’s Important:
Goliaths should exude courage and confidence as a core part of their identity. Even the most hesitant Goliath would still outmatch most other kinships in sheer Bravery.
Gameplay Impact:
Ensures Goliaths feel like natural leaders or front-line combatants, emphasizing their imposing and fearless nature.
5. Shadows' Cunning (8-12 Minimum)
Why It’s Important:
Shadows are defined by their cleverness and subtlety. Even a less strategic Shadow should still be naturally crafty and resourceful.
Gameplay Impact:
This ensures they’re always viable for roles like Shadowblade or Feybinder, where high Cunning is essential.

Summary of Additional Key Exceptions
Kinship	Characteristic	Min-Max Exception	Reason
Goliaths	Strength	12-16	Their raw physical power is unmatched.
Fae	Arcadia	10-12	Reflects their natural magic affinity.
Stonekin	Strength	8-12	Embodies their earthy resilience.
Selkies	Arcadia	10-12	Represents their mystical sea ties.
Goliaths	Bravery	10-12	Captures their bold, fearless nature.
Shadows	Cunning	8-12	Highlights their natural cleverness.

Optional Gameplay Design Consideration:
If these exceptions create too much pressure for players to lean into the "expected" builds (e.g., Fae always being Arcadia-focused), you could introduce backgrounds or sub-kinship options that tweak exceptions slightly. For example:
A "Rebel Fae" might start with lower Arcadia but higher Bravery.
A "Wandering Goliath" could swap higher Cunning for lower Bravery.



How Exceptions Shape Class Synergies and Gameplay Mechanics
Exceptions help to define kinship identities, making certain classes feel natural fits while still leaving room for creative, unconventional builds. Here’s a breakdown of how the exceptions interact with classes, along with ideas for mechanics and synergies.

1. Goliaths (Strength: 12–16, Bravery: 10–12)
Synergies:

Natural Classes:
Knight: Goliaths excel here due to their innate Strength and Bravery, which are critical for frontline combat and absorbing damage.
Skald: Their courage makes them natural leaders in battle, while their physical power supports their martial abilities.
Wild Huntsman: Though less agile than others, their endurance and boldness make them capable hunters.
Mechanics:

Class-Specific Synergy:
Goliaths could gain extra bonuses when paired with specific classes. For example:
Knights: Gain a "Battle Roar" ability that temporarily boosts allies’ Bravery or Strength.
Skalds: Their Bravery amplifies the radius or duration of their rallying cries.
Their high base Strength might let them bypass certain physical challenges (e.g., breaking barriers) that others struggle with.
2. Fae (Arcadia: 10–12)
Synergies:

Natural Classes:
Feybinder: Their high Arcadia and innate connection to the Otherworld make them ideal wielders of faerie magic.
Bard: Their charm (via high Connectedness) pairs beautifully with the magical creativity of this class.
Shadowblade: High Cunning and Arcadia allow them to excel at using stealth and magical trickery.
Mechanics:

Class-Specific Synergy:
Fae characters in magic-heavy roles could receive unique benefits, such as:
Feybinder: Access to fae-specific summons or an innate chance for faerie allies to intervene in combat.
Bards: Gain an "Otherworldly Charm" ability, increasing the likelihood of charming NPCs or pacifying foes.
Their high Arcadia could allow them to bypass or interact with certain magical barriers, like ancient fae wards or enchanted groves.

Stonekin might gain bonuses to crafting or defense in certain roles:
Knights: Gain a "Stonewall" ability, providing increased damage resistance for themselves and nearby allies.
Wild Huntsmen: Gain bonuses to traps or defensive positioning, leveraging their physical durability in the field.
Their innate Strength could make them ideal for puzzle-solving mechanics involving brute force or carrying heavy objects.
4. Selkies (Arcadia: 10–12)
Synergies:

Natural Classes:
Druid: Their high Arcadia and Connectedness make them perfect for nature-based roles.
Bard: Their charm and grace lend themselves to storytelling and performance.

Their balanced stats make them excellent problem-solvers, giving them flexibility in how they approach puzzles or NPC interactions.
Mechanics Overview:
Class-Specific Synergies: Every kinship can unlock unique abilities within specific classes to enhance their gameplay identity.
Environmental Bonuses: Certain kinships, like Selkies or Fae, could interact uniquely with the world, such as navigating magical barriers or aquatic terrain.
Skill-Based Roleplay: High-characteristic values (e.g., Goliath Strength or Fae Arcadia) can open up unique solutions in puzzles, encounters, or NPC interactions.
This approach ensures that kinship exceptions meaningfully impact gameplay, while still allowing players to experiment with creative builds. Would you like more detailed examples of synergies for a specific class or kinship?
